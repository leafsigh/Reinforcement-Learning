# N-Armed-Bandit Problem
N-Armed-Bandit.ipynb now has included the entire algorithms of this interesting problem.
- 4 action selelcting algorithms: epsilon-greedy, softmax, upper bound confidence (UCB) and gradient ascent.
- 2 data generation methods: stationary and nonstationary.
- 2 initial value setup methods: add baseline and setup burning period.

Future works on this script will focus on optimizing the performance and correct potential bugs.

# Dynamic Programming
Currently working on multiple dynamic programming algorithms in MDPs.
